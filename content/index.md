There. You're done. You understand FEP now. (You're welcome.)

# Not sure where to start?

- If you don't know anything about how FEP is derived, start with [[ness formulation|I. Things!]] then move on to [[path integral formulation|II. Paths!]].
- If you're insane and love torturing yourself with math *and* you're already familiar with the NESS formulation and path integral formulation, start with [[qm and gauge|III. Duals!]]
- If you want to understand the practical applications of FEP -- i.e. actually touch grass -- ~~then what the hell are you doing here~~ you will, regrettably, have to wait in great suspense for a post l will write on this... eventually.

# Intended audience

I wrote this for my past self who really wanted to understand FEP, but only knew [single-variable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1), a bit of [probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/pages/part-i-the-fundamentals/), and “learned” linear algebra only from watching [3b1b videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). This is meant to be accessible. Let me know if something is confusing or unclear.
